# Fast-Line-Follower

### Description
The line follower code was written for a national competition at IIT Kanpur. It consisted of a QTR sensor and ultrasonic sensors to follow the wall. I have the image of the robot given below. It was a competition and I wasn't allowed to record the video but I have similar Line Following Robots shown in the video. The video consists of 3 to 4 robots.
